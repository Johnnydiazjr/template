Created a template to have the setup done to begin coding the project 

Extensions allows you to change how VSCode runs 

Some helpful extensions 

Color highlight - shows you an outline of a color before implementing 

Live Server 

Now to create a template 

Create files for html, JS, and CSS

Now some intelligent autocomplete functions in VS code 

HTML 

< -- gives you option for DOCTYPE HTML 

doc -- gives you option for standard HTML documents - head, body, html element 

Now connect HTML with CSS and JS 

Use link element tag 

link - link element with href 

s - style or script 

ctrl + ? = to make a comment 

With the live server extension, now we can click on go live to look at our work 

Modified title to Template 

Next thing we will do, add a few things within the head 
In order to import them 

First is fontawesome 

A site that has many icons we csan use for free

We will add to the title in our template so that we don't have to configure every time 

We will use a CDN, content delivery network to simplify the process of adding it 

https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css

Adding href above style.css

Another trick is word wrap 

alt + Z = will word wrap whatever code is outside the screen 

In font-awesome icon section, copy one of the icons to html file 

<i class="fa-solid fa-mountain"></i>

Now will see icon in the live server 

Web sites look more professional if they have a custom favicon 

Rather than the default globe

Link to article about favicons 

A trick to use google's favicon service 

Can pull a favicon from a site that already exists 

Using google's link

https://www.google.com/s2/u/0/favicons?domain=css-tricks.com

Placing above font awesome in HTML 

 <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://www.google.com/s2/u/0/favicons?domain=jacinto.design">

 Icon as the kind of link, give it a type, which is an image/png, and a link to the design of your personal web page
 In this case we will use instructor's jacinto.design 

 Now get rid of font awesome icon 

 Next lets add some style 

 html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

Box sizing of border box 

What this means is anytime you add padding
That padding will stretch the page 

So lets say you have a page that is 100% of view
It would make it more than 100% and makes a scroll bar

This prevents padding from adding extra height and width to the page 

Next, for the body 

We will addd a margin of zero 

body {
    margin: 0;
    min-height: 100vh;
    background: dodgerblue;
}

Next for the body, we are going to add a margin of zero on all four sides 
and a min-height 

VH stands for viewport height 

So this means we always want it to stretch the background to the top of the screen 

lets give it a color to make sure we see what is going on 

We will remove background color since template will be plain 

This is all we really need to make a template for the course as a base 

Now we will explore hosting on github and dev tools
