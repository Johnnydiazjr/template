Now we test out javascript 

lets go into our script.js file 

We are going to use console logging

window.console.log 

We can see data of our Javascript 

Throughout the course we will look at different features of console.log

Now we will move on to upload to github

Create repository 

Give it a name 

Copy HTTPS

Open terminal 

git init 
git init

Will initialize an empty repository in our folder 

git remote add origin 
git remode add origin 

add the remote origin then paste in the link

then 

git add. 
git add. 

then 

git commit -m 'initial commit' 
git commit -m 'initial commit' 

then finally 

git push origin main
git push origin main 

Now we have the files on github 

If we make a change 

and add an H1 Tab that says hello world for example 

Open up another terminal

Any time you change three commands 

git add . 
git commit - m ''
git push origin main 

Now jump back to repo to see new work 

Go to github page to source main branch 

Now we have a web site where our project is live 

When using github pages, when you enable it for the first time it takes about ten minutes to load
